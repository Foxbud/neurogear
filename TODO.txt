TODO List:

IMMEDIATE:

Use standard exception conventions to clean up all exceptions.
   - Will probably involve deleting and recreating exceptions for every class.
   - Add exceptions to Layer class (correct weight generation issue).



SHORT TERM:

Update all javadoc and comments to be more informative to users.
   - Changing row/column notation to [][]... notation.

Add a sequence generating tool somewhere in utilities.

Create a very clean and robust way of saving and loading DataSets.
   - Maybe use a pre-existing spreadsheet library.



LONG TERM:

Begin work on a Network class.

Devise a way to effectively mutlithread network training.

Add a utility for automated hyperparameter searching.
   - Do research; find the most practical method (balance between efficiency and simplicity).
