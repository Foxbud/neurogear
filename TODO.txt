TODO List:

Redesign as necessary to allow GAN training.

Add a sequence generating tool somewhere in utilities.



SHORT TERM:

Update all packages.
   - Clean exceptions using standard convention.
   - Improve all javadoc to be more informative and professinal.
   - Clean all code comments.

Create a very clean and robust way of saving and loading DataSets.
   - Maybe use a pre-existing spreadsheet library.



LONG TERM:

Begin work on a Network class.

Devise a way to effectively mutlithread network training.

Add a utility for automated hyperparameter searching.
   - Do research; find the most practical method (balance between efficiency and simplicity).
